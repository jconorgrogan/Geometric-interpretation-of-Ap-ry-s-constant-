Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of Zeta function for s=3 that I haven't seen before. 

1. **Geometric Setup**
   - Analyze a unit circle with nodes spaced equidistantly. For each number of nodes \(n\), examine the difference between the arc length \( \frac{2\pi}{n} \) and the straight-line chord length \( 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \) from the node at (1,0) to the next node clockwise.

2. **Difference Formula**
   - Calculate the difference between the arc length and the chord length for each segment 

3. **Approximation for Small Angles**
   - As \(n\) increases, which reduces the segment angle,you can apply the Taylor series approximation for \(\sin(x)\) around 0. This leads  to a formula for the difference as \( \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} \).

4. **Summing Differences**
   - The sum of these differences as \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity is represented by:
     \[
     \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3)
     \]
     where \(\zeta(3)\) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3, also known as Apéry's constant.

5. **Geometric interpretation of Apéry's Constant**
   -  This constant quantifies the cumulative "geometric error" when all arc-to-chord differences across all subdivisions of the circle are summed.
