# Geometric Interpretation of the Riemann Zeta Function: ζ(3) and ζ(6)

## Introduction

Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of Zeta function for ζ(3), Apéry's constant, and another one for ζ(6) that I haven't seen before mentioned in the literature.

## Geometric Setup

Consider a unit circle divided into \(n\) equal segments, with \(n\) ranging from 1 to infinity. For each segment, we examine the difference between the arc length, given by \( \frac{2\pi}{n} \), and the chord length, given by \( 2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) \). As \(n\) increases, the segment angle decreases, and the difference between the arc length and the chord length can be approximated using the Taylor series expansion of \(\sin(x)\) around 0.

# Chord and Arc Lengths

Consider a unit circle with a central angle \(\theta\) (in radians). The arc length \(s\) subtended by this angle is given by:

\[ s = \theta \]

The corresponding chord length \(c\) is given by:

\[ c = 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \]

For small angles \(\theta\), we can use the Taylor series expansion for \(\sin(x)\):

\[ \sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5) \]

Thus, for small \(\theta\):

\[ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \approx \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^3}{6} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48} \]

So the chord length \(c\) becomes:

\[ c = 2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta^3}{48} \right) = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24} \]

## Difference Between Arc Length and Chord Length

The difference between the arc length and the chord length is:

\[ s - c = \theta - \left(\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{24}\right) = \frac{\theta^3}{24} \]

Now, if we divide the unit circle into \(n\) equal segments, each segment subtends an angle \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}\). The difference for each segment is then:

\[ \frac{\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)^3}{24} = \frac{8\pi^3}{24n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} \]

## Sum of the Differences

Summing this difference over all segments as \(n \to \infty\):

\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right) = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3) \]


Next, we involve the sum of the squared differences between the arc lengths and the chord lengths. As \(n\) tends to infinity, the sum of the squared differences approaches \(\frac{\pi^6}{9}\zeta(6)\), where ζ(6) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 6. Formally, we have:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2 \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^6}{9} \zeta(6)
$$

In other words, we can visualize zeta(3), a notoriously mysterious number, as a simple geometric outcome
