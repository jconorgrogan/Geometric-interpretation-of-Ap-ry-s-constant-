Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of Zeta function for ζ(3) that I haven't seen before. 

1. **Geometric Setup**
   - Analyze a unit circle with nodes spaced equidistantly. For each number of nodes \(n\), examine the difference between the arc length \( \frac{2\pi}{n} \) and the straight-line chord length \( 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \) from the node at (1,0) to the next node clockwise.

2. **Difference Formula**
   - Calculate the difference between the arc length and the chord length for each segment 

3. **Approximation for Small Angles**
   - As \(n\) increases, which reduces the segment angle,you can apply the Taylor series approximation for \(\sin(x)\) around 0. This leads  to a formula for the difference as \( \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} \).

4. **Summing Differences**
   - The sum of these differences as \(n\) ranges from 1 to infinity is represented by:
     \[
     \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3)
     \]
     where \(\zeta(3)\) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3, also known as Apéry's constant.

5. **Geometric Setup**
 This constant quantifies the cumulative "geometric error" when all arc-to-chord differences across all subdivisions of the circle are summed.
   -
Consider a unit circle divided into n equal segments, with n ranging from 1 to infinity. For each segment, we examine the difference between the arc length, given by 2π/n, and the chord length, given by 2 sin(π/n). As n increases, the segment angle decreases, and the difference between the arc length and the chord length can be approximated using the Taylor series expansion of sin(x) around 0.

Sum of the Differences:
Our first main result concerns the sum of the differences between the arc lengths and the chord lengths across all segments of the circle. We show that as n tends to infinity, this sum approaches (π^3/3)ζ(3), where ζ(3) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3, also known as Apéry's constant. Specifically, we have:

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right) \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3)$$

Sum of the Squared Differences:
Our second main result involves the sum of the squared differences between the arc lengths and the chord lengths. We demonstrate that as n tends to infinity, the sum of the squared differences approaches (π^6/9)ζ(6), where ζ(6) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 6. Formally, we have:

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2 \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^6}{9} \zeta(6)$$

6. Looking at other zeta values:

When you look at the total area of a hypercube in 4 dimensions and subtract that by the area of a hypersphere in 4 dimensions, you get 1-3*zeta(2) over 16. Another example of zeta funciton showing up geometrically
