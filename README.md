# Geometric Interpretation of the Riemann Zeta Function: ζ(3) and ζ(6)

## Introduction

Stumbled upon this geometric interpretation of Zeta function for ζ(3), Apéry's constant, and another one for ζ(6) that I haven't seen before mentioned in the literature.

## Geometric Setup

Consider a unit circle divided into \(n\) equal segments, with \(n\) ranging from 1 to infinity. For each segment, we examine the difference between the arc length, given by \( \frac{2\pi}{n} \), and the chord length, given by \( 2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{n}) \). As \(n\) increases, the segment angle decreases, and the difference between the arc length and the chord length can be approximated using the Taylor series expansion of \(\sin(x)\) around 0.

## Sum of the Differences

Our first main result concerns the sum of the differences between the arc lengths and the chord lengths across all segments of the circle. We show that as \(n\) tends to infinity, this sum approaches \(\frac{\pi^3}{3}\zeta(3)\), where ζ(3) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3, also known as Apéry's constant. Specifically, we have:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right) \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\pi^3}{3n^3} = \frac{\pi^3}{3} \zeta(3)
$$

Next, we involve the sum of the squared differences between the arc lengths and the chord lengths. As \(n\) tends to infinity, the sum of the squared differences approaches \(\frac{\pi^6}{9}\zeta(6)\), where ζ(6) is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 6. Formally, we have:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{2\pi}{n} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)^2 \approx \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\pi^3}{3n^3}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^6}{9} \zeta(6)
$$
